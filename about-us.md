# About us
### Why this matters
What teachers and young people need are often very specific to their own community, school and classroom.  Different communities have different values, and different communities make different choices about what's important to them in education.  While many communities share common values, some emphasize preparation for achievement in college, others emphasize new ways of including all students in the classroom community, while still others emphasize more holistic forms of assessment.  These communities should be empowered to build around these core values, and make the school data systems that they need.

### What's possible?
(directionally, what we care about on a two year time scale.  aspiration, in place of a "backlog" used for seeding conversations about partnerships)
school data systems that...
- centered student strengths
- were built for educators, young people and families as equal partners
- encouraged taking action on "educational debt"
- helped transition to restorative justice
- helped educators as they make new assessment systems centered on learning instead of filtering

### How we work
Our team approaches these problems with one core value: we work to create more educational opportunity for young people, we don't just build software.  We believe that by building with communities, we all can be more creative, move more quickly, and be more empathetic than other models striving for scale.  We believe this "last mile" is where innovation really occurs, and it's precisely the place where most edtech business models can't reach.  This paragraph is awesomeâ€¦.maybe even bring it up (maybe include team structure, goals, etc. from here, but not in a calling-out way)

While we work, we're committed to being open and transparent.  This involves a commitment to fully open-source software, being a part of our local Code for Boston brigade, and working collaboratively with school communities rather than selling to them.


### Who we have been, who we are, and who we strive to be
OneVille team: This is an separate project altogether that started years before our work, but we  see these folks as allies and our spiritual ancestors :)  Check out the project wiki, Mica's book.
