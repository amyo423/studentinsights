# About us
Our team approaches these problems with one core value: we work to create more educational opportunity for young people, we don't just build software.  We believe that by building with communities, we all can be more creative, move more quickly, and be more empathetic than other models striving for scale.  We believe this "last mile" is where innovation really occurs, and it's precisely the place where most edtech business models can't reach.

What teachers and young people need are often very specific to their own community, school and classroom.  Different communities have different values, and different communities make different choices about what's important to them in education.  While many communities share common values, some emphasize preparation for achievement in college, others emphasize new ways of including all students in the classroom community, while still others emphasize more holistic forms of assessment.  These communities should be empowered to build around these core values, and make the school data systems that they need.


### How we work
While we work, we're committed to being open and transparent.  This involves a commitment to fully open-source software, and working collaboratively with school communities rather than selling anything to them.

Student Insight is open source software, which means anyone can see exactly how it works, or propose changes.  Local educators define any heuristics or algorithms themselves, so that they fully understand how the system works.  We welcome working with community volunteers, and being a part of our local [Code for Boston brigade]({{site.link.code_for_boston}}).

### What could be possible?
It might be hard, but what is school data systems...
- centered student strengths
- were built for educators, young people and families as equal partners
- proactively connected students with community and scholarship opportunities
- helped teams transiting to restorative justice approaches
- encouraged taking concrete actions in the face of "educational debt"
- helped educators as they make new assessment systems centered on learning instead of filtering
