      <p>Itâ€™s <b>people within school communities</b> - teachers, young people, families - who will be able to build the next generation of school data systems that they need.</p>
      <p>The next generation of data systems needs to help us beyond just counting numbers and <b>tackle bigger issues</b>.</p>

<p>The way adults work in other fields is being transformed by technology: chat, customer management databases, business analytics, artificial intelligence.  But most of these don't make sense within the deeply relational and communal work that happens in school communities.   And schools need stronger leadership on the ethical issues related to transparency, privacy, and algorithmic bias.</p>
<p>That next generation of data systems needs to help with problems like: bringing interdisciplinary educational teams together, getting to know young people better as whole people, sharing deeper insights than just data points, digging into root causes and addressing structural equity issues.</p>
<p>We'll need to build this ourselves, together.</p>
