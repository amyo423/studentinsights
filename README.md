      <p>Itâ€™s people closest to the work, <b>within school communities</b> - teachers, young people, families - who will be able to build the next generation of school data systems that they need.</p>
      <p>We need more than just systems for counting numbers - we need ways to more deeply connect and tell our stories to tackle <b>what matters for our students.</b></p>

# Our work
Our work on Student Insights built on work the community had done before [...OneVille, somerville-teacher-tool].  Through that journey, we found that two particular areas really resonated with the school community in Somerville.  Those have formed the core of Student Insights, that we've worked to deepen over time, and the base on which other work is built.
