      <h1 id="what-students-insights-does">What Students Insights Does:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Replaces the paper classroom rosters that Kenya creates using real-time data</li>
  <li>Allows you to see the history of a student (assessments, attendance, discipline, demographics, interventions)</li>
  <li>Serves as a tool for MTSS and SST teams to enter notes and interventions for students</li>
  <li>Generates a student profile needed for a SPED referral (rollout in May)</li>
  <li>Provides an inquiry dashboard that allows for administrators and teams to dig deeper into their student body</li>
  <li>Ensures data security and student privacy (including different levels of user permissions)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="essential-practices-for-mtss--stt-teams">Essential Practices for MTSS &amp; STT Teams:</h1>
<ol>
  <li>At each meeting, make sure there is an LCD projector or Smartboard attached to a laptop, so everyone can view the student profile, notes, and services</li>
  <li>Everyone at the table should know and practice how to add notes/services (rotating model)</li>
  <li>Show teachers how they can access their classroom rosters and individual profiles (using their email address and X2 password)</li>
  <li>Any errors should be shared immediately with Alex (asoble@gmail.com), Kevin (kevin.robinson.0@gmail.com), or Uri (uharel@k12.somerville.ma.us)</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="major-features-in-the-pipeline-for-2016-2017">Major Features In The Pipeline for 2016-2017:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to add attachments (ex. student work) to notes</li>
  <li>Adding additional data points (ex. F&amp;P, gradebook, custom)</li>
  <li>Analytics – “How well does <strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong> intervention work?”</li>
  <li>Alert System – “This student is struggling, but not receiving services….There has been no follow-up since the last MTSS meeting….”</li>
  <li>Expansion to other districts that use X2</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="guidelines-for-entering-notes-and-services">Guidelines for Entering Notes and Services:</h1>
<p>The <strong>Notes</strong> tab is the place to keep notes about a student, whether it’s SST, MTSS, a parent conversation, or some informal strategies that a teacher/team is using to help a student.</p>

<p><em>Who can enter a note?</em>  Anyone who works with or involved with the student, including classroom/ELL/SPED teachers, principals/assistant principals, counselors, and attendance officers.</p>

<p><em>What can I/should I put in a note?</em> The true test is to think about whether the information will help your team down the road in supporting this student, either in the coming weeks, or a few years from now.  Examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Oscar just showed a 20 point increase in ORF.  It seems like the take home readings are working (parents are very supportive) and we will continue it.”</li>
  <li>“This is a follow-up MTSS meeting for Julie.  Over the last 4 weeks, she is not showing many gains despite the volunteer tutor and the change in seating….”</li>
  <li>“Alex just got an M on the latest F&amp;P.  Will try having him go next door to join the other 4th grade group during guided reading.”</li>
  <li>“Medicine change for Uri on 4/10.  So far slight increase in focus.”</li>
  <li>“51a filed on 3/21.  Waiting determination and follow-up from DCF.”</li>
  <li>“Just found that Cora really likes to go help out in grade 1.  Best incentive yet for when she stays on task and completes work.”</li>
  <li>“Arranged for Kevin to go to community schools 2x/week and to get extra homework help.”</li>
  <li>“Julia will do an FBA and report back at the next SST meeting to determine sources of the behavior.”</li>
  <li>“Mediation occurred between Oscar and Uri and went well.  Both have agreed to keep distance for 2 weeks.”</li>
  <li>“Parent called to report that Jill won art award and will be going to nationals.  She suggested this might be an outlet if she shows frustration in schoolwork.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Services</strong> tab is place to keep track of more formal extensive interventions for a student.  It includes a specific person responsible and dates.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reading Teacher: Student works with a reading specialist at least 4x/week for 30-40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Behavior/Attendance Contract: This is usually done in cooperation with the attendance officer, school adjustment counselor, and/or principal.  This is a more formal document that requires a parent and student signature, along with regular checkpoints.</li>
  <li>Attendance Officer: This usually includes home visit(s), regular follow-up, and could later on lead to a formal attendance contract.</li>
  <li>Counseling: Student receives regular weekly or bi-weekly counseling from an SPS counselor or outside (ex. Riverside, Home for Little Wanderers).    One time or infrequent check-ins by a counselor should just be recorded in notes.</li>
</ul>
