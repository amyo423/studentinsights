<ul>
  <li><strong>September 2015</strong>: We will pilot the tool with the Healey School at the start of the 2015-16 school year. We also started looking into out-of-school data e.g., after-school tutoring to help address the question of “Are students in need receiving interventions &amp; support?”.</li>
  <li><strong>August 2015</strong>:  We iterated on the tool, tweaking and adding features prioritized by teachers, principals, and partners. We collaborated with KIPP NJ to build more robust data integration processes and demonstrated how this tool can be deployed more extensively to other districts (even having different SIS systems).</li>
  <li><strong>July 2015</strong>:  We piloted the app with teachers and reading coaches during Summer School. We observed the tool being used by teachers to create flexible groupings by math performance. We received a lot of great feedback on issues, functionalities, and features to work on. At Code for Boston, we held a collaborative coding session with a group of ~10 volunteers and built out the export CSV function.</li>
  <li><strong>June 2015</strong>:  We tested the app with more teachers now and building out the student profile features with the help of Code for SF and Code for Boston brigade volunteers.</li>
  <li><strong>May 2015</strong>:  We consider the app an alpha product now. Our focus is on building out the student profile feature and improving the roster view while testing working iterations with our teacher partners at Healey.</li>
  <li><strong>April 2015</strong>:  We had our first call with Healey teachers and principal to get feedback on a working prototype of the app using real data.</li>
  <li><strong>March 2015</strong>:  We started writing and testing functions to import data from Somerville’s Student Information System and student assessment sources.</li>
  <li><strong>February 2015</strong>:  We met with the fantastic 5th grade teacher team at Healey throughout the month to learn about the challenges they face, see the current tools they use, and sketch paper prototypes together.</li>
  <li><strong>January 2015</strong>: We kicked up this app during Build Week as a warm-up getting-to-know-you exercise. The initial product idea and subsequent feedback came from Stephanie Hirsch. This app drew from a single set of de-identified sample data from Excel to generate risk levels by homeroom, so it couldn’t do anything useful in the wild. We said: “If this demo seems promising to stakeholders and early iterations prove useful, it could grow up over the course of the fellowship year.”</li>
