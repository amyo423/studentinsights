# Our work
Our work on Student Insights built on work the community had done before [...OneVille, somerville-teacher-tool].  Through that journey, we found that two particular areas really resonated with the school community in Somerville.  Those have formed the core of Student Insights, that we've worked to deepen over time, and the base on which other work is built.
