<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">How we work</h2>
Student Insights started in one school in Somerville in 2014, trying to integrate data from different vendors' data systems.  We found right away that the technical side of data interoperability was the easy part - finding ways to **grow and sustain student-centered practices** was much harder, but more meaningful.

As we started working with more schools, we also shifted the way we worked.  We focused less on the technology and more on the **last mile** of how our work could influence practice.  This led to new kinds of opportunities, grounded in the core values of: *seeing the whole-child*, *student-centered narratives* and embracing challenges around *trust, access and privacy*.
