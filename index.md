        <p>We need more than just systems for counting numbers - we need ways to more deeply connect and tell our stories to tackle <b>what matters for our students.</b></p>

## Our work
Our work on Student Insights built on the work that has [come before](about-us.html).  As we've worked, we found that three particular areas really resonated with the school community in Somerville.  Those have formed the core of Student Insights, that we've worked to deepen over time, and the base on which all other work is built.
